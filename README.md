# Solitaire

Solitaire is a collaborative school project I developed alongside my classmate, Myha. We recreated the classic Solitaire game using Java and JavaFX, aiming to provide an engaging and immersive user experience.

The project demonstrates our proficiency in Graphical User Interface (GUI) development by incorporating features like event handling, graphical effects, the Singleton design pattern, polymorphism, and more.

To run this application, simply download and execute the compiled .jar file from https://github.com/Kin-Choi/SolitaireMaven/blob/master/out/artifacts/SolitaireMaven_jar/SolitaireMaven.jar.
